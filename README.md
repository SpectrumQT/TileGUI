## Features  
- **INI Native** — Designed as .ini with bunch of HLSL shaders, no .dll required
- **Fully Dynamic** — All Tile properties can be changed on the fly 
- **Expandible** — Create your own CustomShaders to directly modify data arrays
- **Highly Optimized** — Aims to minimize performance footprint
- **Robust** — Stateless architecture isolates clients from each other


## Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/SpectrumQT/TileGUI/releases) of TileGUI.zip and extract it to your \3dmigoto\ folder

Correct path to extracted TileGUI folder should look like:

 ```
 \3dmigoto\Mods\BufferValues\TileGUI
 ```

## How To Use As Mod User

Just install it if you have any mods requiring TileGUI. Framework won't do anything on its own.


## How To Use As Mod Author

Framework is currently in the early alpha-testing phase with no docs ready. Also, while current API is unlikely to change significantly, there's absolutely no guarantee that it'll be compatible with first modder-friendly release. I'd advice to wait for further announcements before jump into.
